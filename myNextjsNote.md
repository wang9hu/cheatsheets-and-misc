## NEXT.js

- Nextjs Pre-renders every page, there are two forms of pre-rendering
  1. Static Generation(Recommanded): The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be **reused** on each request.(good for CDN, faster load time)
  1. Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on each request

- These two forms can hybrid together for better performance
